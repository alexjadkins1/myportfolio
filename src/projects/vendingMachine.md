title: Voice Activated Vending Machine
text: I created a voice activated vending machine that may be used in Unity Projects. I used nixon-voxell's custom Unity package UnityNLP in order to train a Naive Bayes classifier model. This model is then used in conjunction with the Unity's DictionRecognizer API in order to parse input from a microphone and facilitate an order. Video demonstration below!
