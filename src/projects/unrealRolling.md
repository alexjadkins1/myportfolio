title: Rolling Balls Using Boid Behavioral Model
slug: cloud-shader
text: I created a flock of rolling actors using the boid behavioral model. This required the use of three separate forces; Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion. The separation force moves outward balls away from the player. The alignment force steers all balls towards the average velocity of the flock. The cohesion force moves the balls in the average center of mass of balls around it. When these three forces combine, it produces a bird like flock effect. Click picture for video demonstration.
