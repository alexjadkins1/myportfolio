            <h3>About Me</h3><br></br>
                
            <p>An avid coder since early high school, I started working in game development in college. 
            I joined my school's game development club, and joined a team of five other students working 
            on building out a playable game over the school year.</p>

            <p>Once coronavirus lock down began in early 2020, I began working on my own 2D sprite based
            game in Unity. It was challenging, but I implemented a procedural map design, with 3 different 
            enemy types and a boss. All art assets were designed and created by me!</p>

            <p>Beginning in the summer of 2021, I started working at Code In The Schools. I have taught numerous 
            Intro to Unity courses, and have taught coding in Baltimore City Public Schools.</p>
            
            <p>During 2022, I worked on and created a 3D exploratory game entitled Shades of Autumn. Designing and 
            coding all aspects of the game, I aimed to create a laid back experience.</p>

            <p>Additionally during 2022, I worked with an experimental natural language package in Unity to create 
            a voice facilitated vending machine.</p>
