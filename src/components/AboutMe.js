            <p>A creatively driven software engineer. I've designed and build desktop applications for the last two years.
            These applications contained a wide array of features such as 3D viewports for visualiation of data,
            binary serialization of data and custom drawing of graphical user interfaces.
            I've developed frontend applications that interface with machine vision cameras to enable dynamic imaging.</p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy maintained my passion for video game development by creating virtual experiences.
            I am a fast learner. I am continously driven to master new techniques and software to realize my vision with personal projects.
            I've taught a college accredited course in video game development and love teaching others what I have learned.</p>
